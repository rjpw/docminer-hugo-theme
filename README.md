# docminer-hugo-theme

Hugo theme for a document repository.

The use case for this theme is to provide some navigation aids and search tools for linked content that appears in non-HTML formm, i.e. PDF, PPT, DOCX, etc.

## Roadmap

The development of this theme is in its earliest stages, and is not yet ready for use. Once the initial construction work is complete, this README will be expanded to include features, examples, and a link to a sample site.

## Theme Foundation

This structure of this theme was created by following an [excellent tutorial by Janne Kemppainen](https://www.pakstech.com/blog/create-hugo-theme/), up to [step seven](https://www.pakstech.com/blog/hugo-list-page/). True to Mr. Kemppainen's experience, working with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io) has proven to be an excellent starting point.
